The Beaver Dam
The setting is early spring, in 'Meadowlark forest'
The animals are just waking up from hibernation, but our hero is sleeping in!
Bobbi (The girlfriend. Probably not named Bobbi) wakes you up
	You start out staring at the ceiling. Turning to look at Bobbi is your mouse tutorial
	Walk towards her. Walking tutorial
	Talk to her. Talking tutorial
	Jumping tutorial. Haven't figured it out yet
The beavers are repairing the dam, and you help them out to learn your moves
	Part of the roof has fallen in, and there's rubble everywhere. Use your basic attacks to break up the rubble
	Piles of sticks or logs need to be moved across the dam. Use your taxi ability to move them
	Holes in the floor are being patched up. Use the tail slam to pat down the mud
	The roof is leaking. Use the mud-slinging ability to plug the holes
Wooden statue quest guy is also here.
	You go around the beaver dam collecting 5 pieces of the special wood
	They are probably just jutting out of the walls
If you haven`t done all of the other jobs yet, he tells you it will take him a while to finish the statue

After you finish all of these missions, Cinematic. You go to statue quest guy as he`s putting the finishing touch on the statue. Suddenly someone runs in and announces that Gary the hunter is back! Segway into level 1
