Wake up sleepy head!

You've been dozing for months!

Your neck must be stiff after hibernation! Why don't you use the mouse to look around?

Quit staring at the ceiling silly! I'm down here.

Hey there! Make sure you take the time to look around. There's plenty of hidden secrets to find in the Meadowlark forest.

Now you better get up and stretch those legs. Use the WADS keys to walk around.

Why don't you walk over here and say hello?

Come on Baxter! I don't bite!

Cat got your tongue? Use the E key to talk to people

Don't be shy!

Well good morning to you too! It's a good idea to talk to everyone you meet. They might need your help!

Speaking of, everyone's been busy cleaning up while you've been down here sleeping. You should go ask around and see who could use a hand!
